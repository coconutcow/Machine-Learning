Hi,
I am not a polymath, but a strong believer in the purity of knowledge. My quest to Machine Learning began out of an epiphany, and it has had me engulfed by it's potential and credibility.
This is a short snippet of the quick projects that I have been involved with, and I hope it helps you, and can contribute to finding your path through this demanding, yet interesting journey.
